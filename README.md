# Whale Analysis

This project uses some quantitative analysis techniques with Python and Pandas to evaluate the performance among various algorithmic, hedge, and mutual fund portfolios and compare them against the S&P 500. A conclusion is arrived at based on which portfolio is performing best across multiple areas including: volatility, returns, risk, and Sharpe ratios.

## Findings

When compared with the other portfolios, my portfolio came in second place losing only to Algo 1. I would also like to point out that the time window for the data in my portfolio is significantly shorter than that of the other portfolios. Because of this, when my portfolio was added to the dataframe, the entire dataframe was cut to the length of my portfolio. As a result, the information obtained at the end of this assignment differs from what we saw before the custom portfolio was added. Either way, our custom portfolio, as well as Algo 1, are still the best performing portfolios out of the bunch. I am only mentioning all this because I have noticed that some of the other portfolios did better than others over a longer time period while others had better results over a shorter time period.
